# MemoryStream Enhanced Features Integration Guide

This document outlines how the enhanced features are integrated into the MemoryStream application architecture.

## 1. Enhanced Intelligence Features

### Content Recognition

The content recognition system automatically identifies shows and movies being watched:

1. `ContentRecognitionService.js` in the backend analyzes dialogue text from the subtitle stream
2. It extracts potential movie/show titles and character names
3. It queries TMDB API to find matching content
4. When content is identified, the system:
   - Displays content information in the TV UI
   - Provides context for the AI assistant for more informative responses
   - Enables personalized recommendations

**Data Flow:**
```
Audio → Whisper → TranscribedText → ContentRecognitionService → TMDB API → ContentMetadata
```

### Scene-Based Context

The scene analysis system provides understanding of what's happening on screen:

1. `SceneAnalysisService.js` captures frames from the video at regular intervals
2. Frames are sent to OpenAI's Vision model for analysis
3. The system identifies characters, actions, settings and objects
4. This information is aggregated to build a continuous scene understanding
5. Used to provide context for questions about visual elements not mentioned in dialogue

**Data Flow:**
```
VideoFrames → SceneAnalysisService → GPT-4 Vision → SceneContext → Enhanced QA
```

### Personalized Recommendations

The recommendation engine delivers content suggestions based on viewing history and interactions:

1. `RecommendationService.js` tracks user interactions with content
2. It builds user preference profiles for genres, actors, etc.
3. It generates recommendations using:
   - TMDB similar content API
   - User preference matching with available content
   - GPT-4 for context-aware recommendations
4. Recommendations are displayed in the TV UI and can be saved to mobile

**Data Flow:**
```
UserInteractions → RecommendationService → UserProfiles → TMDB + GPT-4 → Recommendations
```

## 2. Multi-Device Experience

### Shared Viewing with Synchronized Playback

Enables multiple viewers to share a synchronized viewing experience:

1. `SharedViewingService.js` manages viewing sessions
2. Host creates a session and generates a join code
3. Other users join the session by entering the code
4. The service synchronizes playback state across all devices
5. WebSocket connections maintain real-time communication

**Implementation Details:**
- Session state is maintained on the server
- State changes are broadcast to all connected clients
- Syncing algorithm accounts for network latency
- Host has playback control by default, but can grant it to others

### Collaborative Q&A

Allows multiple users to ask and answer questions about the content:

1. Questions are submitted through the mobile app
2. Questions are shared with all session participants
3. Anyone can provide answers or "like" existing answers
4. AI can also provide answers based on the dialogue context
5. Questions and answers are persisted for the session

**User Flow:**
- User asks question via mobile app
- Question appears on all connected devices
- Others can contribute answers
- Question appears with timestamp related to video content
- Users can navigate to specific points in video from questions

### "Send to Mobile" Functionality

Lets users save content from TV to their mobile device:

1. `MobileSaver.js` component on mobile receives saved items
2. TV app can send various types of content:
   - Links to related content
   - Timestamps with notes
   - Screenshots/images
   - Information about actors, characters, etc.
3. Items are stored locally on the mobile device

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses WebSocket for sending data from TV to mobile
- LocalStorage/IndexedDB for persistent storage on mobile
- Custom notification system for new items

## 3. Technical Showcases

### Near Real-Time Subtitle Processing

Optimized subtitle generation system:

1. `OptimizedWhisperService.js` processes audio in small chunks
2. Uses batch processing to optimize API usage
3. Multiple chunks are merged for better context
4. Parallel processing with worker limits for efficiency
5. Results streamed back to clients as soon as available

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Audio chunking and merging
- Batch processing to reduce API calls
- Caching of recent results
- Adjustable processing parameters

### Local Wake Word Detection

Reduces latency for voice commands:

1. `WakeWordDetector.js` runs entirely on the mobile device
2. Uses the Web Speech API with fallback to TensorFlow.js models
3. Continuously listens for the wake word ("hey memory")
4. When detected, activates full voice command mode
5. Maintains a buffer of recent audio to reduce initial processing delay

**Technical Implementation:**
- WebAudio API for audio processing
- Web Speech API for primary detection
- RecordRTC for audio recording
- TensorFlow.js as an optional detection method

### Adaptive Streaming Quality

Optimizes video quality based on network conditions:

1. `AdaptiveStreamingManager.js` integrates with the video player
2. Monitors network connection quality and stability
3. Adjusts streaming parameters in real-time:
   - Resolution (height/width)
   - Bitrate
   - Buffer size
4. Handles network changes and interruptions gracefully

**Key Features:**
- Real-time bandwidth measurement
- Quality level thresholds (low, medium, high, auto)
- Connection monitoring (type, speed, metered status)
- Fallback mechanisms for offline/limited connectivity

## System Integration

These features integrate within the existing architecture:

1. **Backend Integration:**
   - New services are added to the backend server
   - Services communicate via events and shared state
   - WebSocket handlers are extended to support new message types

2. **TV App Integration:**
   - VideoPlayer component is enhanced with adaptive streaming
   - UI updated to display content recognition results
   - New UI elements for session management and collaborative features

3. **Mobile App Integration:**
   - New tabs for saved items and shared viewing
   - Background wake word detection
   - Collaborative Q&A interface

4. **Cross-Component Communication:**
   - WebSockets for real-time communication
   - Shared session state
   - Content IDs used as common references

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Caching strategies for recognized content and recommendations
   - Efficient buffer management for streaming
   - Battery usage optimization for wake word detection

2. **Scalability:**
   - Shared viewing sessions can be distributed across server instances
   - Whisper API usage is optimized through batching
   - Content recognition results are cached

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Key metrics for tracking system health:
     - Subtitle processing latency
     - Streaming adaptation frequency
     - Session synchronization accuracy
     - Wake word detection precision

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:

1. **Enhanced Intelligence:**
   - Full video understanding (not just frames)
   - Actor identification with face recognition
   - Extended content database beyond TMDB

2. **Multi-Device Experience:**
   - Screen mirroring for companion content
   - Multi-room synchronized playback
   - Cross-device persistent viewing history

3. **Technical Improvements:**
   - Fully local subtitle generation
   - Customizable wake words and voice models
   - HDR and advanced codec support
