# AI Decision Log

This document tracks significant decisions made by the AI assistant during the development of MemoryStream.

## Project Setup (2024-06-01)

### Initial Repository Structure
Created the core project structure with three main components:
- TV App: For the Senza platform interface
- Mobile App: For the companion web application
- Backend: For AI processing and WebSocket communication

### Architecture Rule Files
Created .cursor/rules/ directory with service-specific MDC files:
- architect.mdc: System-wide architecture guidelines
- tv-service.mdc: TV application specific rules
- mobile-service.mdc: Mobile companion app rules
- backend-service.mdc: Backend service rules

### Technology Choices
Based on the PRD and ADRs, confirmed the following technology decisions:
- TV App: Vanilla JavaScript with Senza SDK integration
- Mobile App: Progressive Web App with WebRTC and Socket.io
- Backend: Node.js with Express, Socket.io, and OpenAI SDK

### Implementation Strategy
Decided to implement the project in phases as outlined in the PRD:
1. Foundation: Basic TV app, mobile companion, and server setup
2. AI Integration: Whisper for subtitles, GPT for Q&A
3. Enhancement: Advanced features like timestamp search
4. Polish: UI refinements and error handling

## Implementation Progress (2024-06-15)

### Core Components Implemented
- Backend: WebSocket server with namespace structure, session management
- TV App: ShakaPlayer integration, remote navigation system, subtitle display
- Mobile App: QR code pairing, remote control interface, voice input

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Socket.io namespaces to separate concerns (TV, mobile, subtitles, voice)
- In-memory session storage for the demo (can be replaced with Redis)
- Mobile-TV pairing via QR code for seamless connection
- Modular component structure for better maintainability

### Performance Optimizations
- Used vanilla JavaScript over frameworks to reduce bundle size
- Implemented efficient spatial navigation for TV remote control
- Optimized WebSocket event structure to minimize payload size

## Next Steps
- Complete OpenAI integration for real-time subtitles
- Implement timestamp-based content search
- Add error handling for network disruptions
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Optimize for low-end devices
